>>>>>>> Stashed changes
 easy others to hard but if you look you will find that the are all interesting (in my opinion)#1the Harry Potter series(hard for
 most)#2 Goddess Girls(goes from easy or half hard and gets harder)#3Gold Medal Winter or Gold Medal Summer(depends)
 For girls who don't love to read if it is hard try to learn if you don't have time just try and if you just don't like to read 
 and you don't do sports try some you might like soccer,basket ball,ballet,gymnastics,softball,and swimming or any other sport 
 you like sports are good for you but you might want to choose an easy sport for fun and the do acting (drama)what 
 I am saying is don't do something that takes a lot of hours but you should make time for homework even if you like me dislike it
