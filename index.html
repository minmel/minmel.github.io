 <h1> Girls Change the World</h1>
 <p>Welcome to my cool girls website.
 I really hope you <strong style="color:aquamarine;">enjoy my blog</strong></p>
      <strong style="color:fusha;"><p> Girls and their intrests</strong></p>
   Some girls love to read and that's great others don't for you that is fine if you love to read some of these books may be to
 easy others to hard but if you look you will find that the are all intresting (in my opinion)#1the Harry Potter series(hard for
 most)#2 Goddes Girls(goes from easy or half hard and gets harder)#3Gold Medal Winter or Gold Medal Summer(depends).For girls
 who don't love to read if it is hard try to learn if you don't have time just try and if you just don't like to read and you
 don't do sports try some you might like soccer,basket ball,ballet,gymnastics,softball,and swimming or any other sport you like
 sports are good for you but you might want to choose an easy sport for fun and the do acting (drama)what I am saying is dont do something that takes alot of hours but you should make time for homework even if you like me dislike it
